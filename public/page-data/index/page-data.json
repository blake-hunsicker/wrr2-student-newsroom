For nearly three months, millions of Chileans protested in the streets, paralyzing the country’s cities, and its economy, in the process. Not only did this envelope Chile in a cloud of uncertainty, but it also raised new hopes among the most economically vulnerable that their needs were going to be heard by the government.\n\nThe national movement that resulted in the Social Crisis began after the government’s expert council for metropolitan transportation announced a fare increase for “Metro de Santiago”, the subway system of Santiago, Chile’s capital. Student groups began to riot, first in Santiago, and were soon joined by unions and social organizations across the country. For weeks, police and protesters clashed in the streets, destroying public and private infrastructure.\n\nWhat started as a complaint against increasing subway fare metastasized into widespread anger over Chile’s high cost of living, low pensions rates, and exorbitant medical and health-care bills, signalling deep antipathy towards public institutions and political elites.\n\n32 people died, 3,400 protesters, bystanders, and curfew breakers were hospitalized, and more than 3,000 policemen were hurt in the clashes; another 8,000 people were arrested or detained. Many human rights institutions accused the Chilean government of human rights violations while also highlighting several severe cases of police excess.\n\nNationwide unrest led to a financial crisis. With protesters flooding urban commercial areas, businesses were forced to close. 300,000 workers lost their jobs and at least 700 stores were looted. Making matters worse, the Chilean peso suffered an historical devaluation and the country’s GDP was forecasted to shrink by at least 1% in 2020.\n\nNormally one of Chile’s busiest urban areas, Viña del Mar is now half empty and eerily quiet. In fact, it is virtually unrecognizable.\n\nHowever, the Social Crisis also triggered the announcement of various political and social changes, including an increase to pensions and the minimum wage, upgrades to the national public health system, higher taxes on the rich, and the creation of a new national welfare system for children. The process also resulted in the government calling for a referendum in April to alter Chile’s constitution.\n\nDespite these announcements, a new wave of social unrest appeared to be building. By March 2020, pro-union movements were calling for new protests against President Sebastián Piñera’s government, signalling the potential for another phase of systemic paralysis in Chile. At the time, few envisioned that such a paralysis would be caused by a force more powerful than a societal schism. \n   \nOn March 3, while the country was still attempting to resume normal operations, the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the city of Talca, located 150 miles to the south of Santiago, in the heart of the country. It did not take long for the virus to spread throughout Chile, infecting thousands of people and shutting down most of society for the second time in six months. \n\nWith Chile under lockdown, the government postponed the constitutional referendum and\nissued nationwide measures to contain the virus and forestall a collapse of Chile’s health-care system. Citizens were asked to adopt social distancing tactics and to wear masks when venturing outside of their homes. In addition, a temporary evening curfew was instituted, and some urban centers were placed under quarantine.\n\nIvan Reinoso, 24, is a journalism student from Viña del Mar, a coastal resort city lying northwest of Santiago. In April, after confining himself indoors for more than a month – first with his mother, and then with his partner, Nicole – he left his apartment for the first time in order to accompany Nicole to a health clinic.    \n\nThe following video documents their trip into the city’s center. Normally one of Chile’s busiest urban areas, Viña del Mar is now half empty and eerily quiet. In fact, it is virtually unrecognizable to these two young students still reeling from the past six months of turmoil. \n\n","Featured_image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/eab9b5c433be67aefb5540b7161ce52b/10c0ebe7/Picture2.jpg"}],"Status":"Complete","Blurb":"A day in Chile under COVID-19"}},{"data":{"Title":"Outlasting COVID-19: A Brooklyn Food Vendor Fights To Stay In Business","Authors":"Dayo Paul Oluwakoya","Slug":"outlasting-COVID-19","Body":"When Hema Ugwu first opened Brooklyn Suya on Franklin Avenue in Crown Heights, his aim was to introduce Brooklynites to the deliciously hot flavors of Nigeria's street food scene.

COVID-19 has changed how we live our lives and has disrupted our routines: remote work instead of office work, social isolation over happy hours, and days and weeks spent at home instead of moviegoing, retail shopping, and dining out.\n\nWhile these habits are new to the majority of us, one cohort adopted physical confinement and digital landscapes years ago. Gamers and streamers: your time has arrived.\n\nThese gaming enthusiasts – commonly portrayed as nerds and geeks with encyclopedic knowledge of fantasy worlds, high technological expertise, and very limited social skills — have become the rockstars of our times by exposing their hobbies to audiences of hundreds of thousands on online platforms like Twitch, Mixr, and YouTube.\n\nBy playing games, building computers, critiquing anime series, or simply chatting with their virtual followers in front of a camera, microphone and screen for many hours a day, men and women of all ages have cultivated profitable, professional careers out of their hobbies. \n\nTheir backgrounds are as diverse as their interests, but they all seem to possess the same trait: a passion for communicating and sharing their hobbies.\n\nFrancisca Sky, popularly known as Pancha Sky, is one of them. Despite her extensive academic background in advertising, politics and philosophy, she chose a career in games. She worked for Riot Games,the publisher of titles like League of Legends and Teamfight Tactics, and recently created her own YouTube channels. Now gathering tens of thousands of viewers each week, she has become one of the most prolific and promising streamers in her native Chile and all of Latin America.\n\n<div class=\"post-youtube-video\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XMfbVFXaAOc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.twitchmetrics.net/games/viewership\" target=\"_blank\">According to TwitchMetrics</a>, Valorant, League of Legends, Fortnite and Counter Strike: Global Offensive are currently the top four most streamed and watched video games on the internet, surpassing 500 million hours of view time in the last 30 days alone. Most of these titles have spawned entire competitive scenes around them, with top players earning tens of millions of dollars in the process.\n\nBut the digital world has space for everybody, even those  with an analog past. A clear example of this is Magic: The Gathering, the original collectible card game created by Wizards of the Coast in 1993, which recently launched a full version of its Arena platform, a free software that allows players to play the card game online. \n\nWhile Magic: The Gathering created their original Online platform in the early 2000s, this new video game, with an improved interface and better graphics, represents a clear effort to grab the attention of younger audiences and to jump into the industry of esports. \n\nLast February, <a href=\"https://magic.gg/events/magic-world-championship-xxvi\" target=\"_blank\">Magic World Championship XXVI</a> was played in Arena, marking the first time in the tournament’s history that it was held digitally. The prize pool was $1 million. Long-time players and professionals of the game have flocked to the streaming world, finding new opportunities and spaces for themselves inside it.\n\nCovertGoBlue, Daniel Wagner’s digital persona, is a part of this group. He fell in love with Magic: The Gathering in his adolescence, and even tried to make it into the traditional Pro Tour, without meeting with much success, unfortunately. But with the rise of Arena and the thriving environment of streaming platforms, he saw a new opportunity to make the game a professional outlet.\n\n<iframe class=\"spotify-embed\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/819704467&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\n\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, the number of streamers and gamers online has increased. Based on data by <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/twitch.tv#referrals\" target=\"_blank\">SimilarWeb</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.apptopia.com/twitch-mixer-caffeine-and-discord-all-just-posted-their-best-revenue-generating-month\" target=\"_blank\">Apptopia</a>, Twitch viewership has increased by roughly 20%; meanwhile, the number of concurrent gamers on Counter Strike: Global Offensive and Call of Duty: Warzone has also risen, according to distributors. Likewise, the number of unique channels in Twitch has increased by 33.3% during the first quarter of the year, according to a <a href=\"https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-stream-hatchet-q1-2020-live-streaming-industry-report-9630bc3e0e1e\" target=\"_blank\">Streamlabs report</a>.\n\nIn the following video, Martina Marcaccio, an Uruguayan streaming personality who operates under the alias of SookieDoll, discusses these changes in the industry. As a gamer and inside member of the LLA (Latin America League of Riot’s League of Legends), she recognizes a link between the rising interest in esports and gaming platforms and the current global situation, and dares to share her predictions on its future.\n\n<div class=\"post-youtube-video\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8korbmpy6cQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>","Featured_image":[{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/da8ef3ab1465096488ae6879c117453e/cc80e488/00IMG_5649.jpg"}],"Status":"Complete","Blurb":"In times where COVID-19 has forced all of us to retreat at home, some professions and careers are thriving.
